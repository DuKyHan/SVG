## Stroke
 stroke: The stroke color
 stroke-width : Width of stroke; may be given as user coordinates or with a length specifier. The stroke
  width is centered along the abstract grid lines. Default is 1.
 stroke-opacity: A number ranging from 0.0 to 1.0; 0.0 is entirely transparent; 1.0 is entirely opaque(the default).
 stroke-dasharray: A series of numbers that tell the length of dashes and gaps with which a line is to be drawn. These numbers are in user coordinates only. The default value is none
 stroke-linecap: Shape of the ends of a line; has one of the values butt (the default), round, or square
 stroke-linejoin: The shape of the corners of a polygon or series of lines; has one of the values miter (pointed; the default), round, or bevel (flat).
 stroke-miterlimit: Maximum ratio of length of the miter point to the width of the lines being drawn; the default value is 4.
## Fill
 fill:  fill-color
 fill-opacity: A number ranging from 0.0 to 1.0; 0.0 is entirely transparent; 1.0 (the default) is entirely opaque.
 fill-rule: This attribute can have the values nonzero (the default)or evenodd,which apply
different rules for determining whether a point is inside or outside a shape.
