moveto: a capital M followed by an x- and y-coordinate.This command sets the current location of the “pen” that’s
drawing the outline.
lineto: a capital L followed by an x- and y-coordinate. Draw the line
closepath:  a capital Z ,  draw a straight line back to the beginning point of the current subpath.

### Summary
M m     (x,y)    Move to given coordinates
L l     (x,y)    Draw a line to the given coordinates. You may supply multiple sets of coordinates to draw a polyline. 
H h     (x)      Draw a horizontal line to the given x-coordinate.
V v     (y)     Draw a vertical line to the given x-coordinate
A a     (rx ry x-axis-rotation large-arc sweep x y). Draw an elliptical arc from the current point to (x,y). The points are on
an ellipse with x-radius rx and y-radius ry. The ellipse is rotated
x-axis-rotation degrees. If the arc is less than 180 degrees,
large-arc is 0; if greater than 180 degrees, large-arc is 1. If the
arc is to be drawn in the positive direction, sweep is 1; otherwise it is 0.
Q q (x1 y1 x y) Drawaquadratic Bézier curve from the current point to (x,y) using control point (x1,y1).
T t (x,y)   Draw aquadratic Bézier curvefromthecurrentpoint to(x,y).Thecontrol
point will be the reflection of the previous Q command’s control point. If
there is no previous curve, the current point will be used as the control
point.
C c (x1 y1 x2 y2 x y) Draw a cubic Bézier curve from the current point to (x,y) using control
point (x1,y1) as the control point for the beginning of the curve and
(x2,y2) as the control point for the endpoint of the curve
S s (x2 y2 x y) Draw a cubic Bézier curve from the current point to (x,y), using (x2,y2)
as the control point for this new endpoint. The first control point will be
the reflection of the previous C command’s ending control point. If there
is no previous curve, the current point will be used as the first control
point.
